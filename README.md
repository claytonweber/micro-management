# Micro-Management!

Use the command line to navigate through a MySql database. Keep track of employees, roles, departments, and more!

To get started

- clone the repo

- log in to mysql

- SOURCE db/schema.sql;

- USE employees_db;

- SOURCE db/seeds.sql;

- quit

then you'll want run npm i, then npm start

Inquirer should take care of the prompting!
